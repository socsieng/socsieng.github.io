# Jekyll on GitHub Pages

This repository is the [socsieng.github.io](https://socsieng.github.io/) blog.

While the content and the words are mine, any code, scripts, templates, etc. are available for all to use.

I'll be creating an _empty_ branch that will contain scripts and configuration used and created while maintaining this
blog. I hope that others can use it to bootstrap their own blog.
