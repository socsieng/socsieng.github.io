My wife saw U.S. Representative [Ted Lieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lieu) on TV today and thinks we look the
same. For the record, we don't.

![Ted and I](/assets/img/ted-lieu.jpg) _For anyone else who thinks they're the same people, that's me on the left and
Ted Lieu on the right._

I think she might be racist. That or she needs new glasses.

The sad thing is that Ted is 11 years my senior and looks younger than me. ðŸ˜­.
