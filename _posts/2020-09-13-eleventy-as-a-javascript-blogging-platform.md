[Eleventy High Performance Blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) made it into my feed today. I
hadn't even heard of [Eleventy (11ty)](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) before today so I thought I'd check it out.

What piqued my interest about [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) was this:

> A simpler static site generator. An alternative to Jekyll. Written in **JavaScript**. Transforms a directory of
> templates (of varying types) into HTML.

**Emphasis** mine.

It's actually more like:

I'm much more familiar with JavaScript than I am with Ruby (Jekyll is built with Ruby). While the idea of being able
easily make changes to the static site generator sounds compelling, the truth is that I just don't have the time. Had I
known about Eleventy when I started blogging (or done some more up front analysis), I may have chosen it as my blogging
platform.

As a software engineer, I feel like I am constantly being tempted by the next new thing whether it's a new platform,
language, or framework. I think it's important to be aware of what is happening around you, but to also think
objectively about the benefits. In this case, it would be a new capability that I have no plans to use. As such, I've
got no plans to switch.
