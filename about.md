I am a Developer Advocate with the Google Pay team currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I relocated from
Sydney Australia when I took on this role.

I've been involved in software engineering since 2001 and find that I am constantly learning new things and with this
blog, I hope to share some of the things that I have and will learn (big or small). I am writing for myself, but hope
that it provides value to any visitors who stumble across blog.
