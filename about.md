I am a Developer Advocate with the Google Pay team currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area (originally from Sydney
Australia, and Cambodia before that).

I've been involved in software engineering since 2001 working in small and large organizations. I'm constantly learning
and I've made the decision to document what I learn with this blog. Primarily for myself, and secondarily for anyone who
happens to stumble upon it.
